# hithe
## Description

Personal collection of docker image building files.

Built images are usually pushed to the
[docker hub registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/graemeastewart/).

Note that a few images are built using source code archives, these
are excluded from this repository and the Dockerfile should have 
instructions as to where to download these from.

## Name

*Hithe* is an archaic English word for a dock.
